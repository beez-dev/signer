## Brief

E-signatures are a way to digitize a form of contract. A contract is essentially
an agreement and an acceptance to an agreement.

This application demonstrates a simple mechanism to be able to accept an
owner's document that s/he has sent via the recepient's email.

The recepient is able to download the document, and accept the contract
via the links sent to his email
